# CSCI3343_Analysis_of_Algorithms

## Project Overview
Welcome to the CSCI3343_Analysis_of_Algorithms repository! This collaborative project is dedicated to enhancing Anki decks for the CSCI3343 Analysis of Algorithms course. Our goal is to create a comprehensive resource that helps students better understand and memorize complex algorithms through effective spaced repetition learning.

### Project Structure
- **/decks/**: This directory contains the shared Anki decks available for download.
- **/guidelines/**: Here, you'll find the guidelines for contributing to the repository, including how to format and submit your Anki cards.
- **/resources/**: Additional resources and links to further reading materials or online courses.

## Setup and Installation
To get started with these Anki decks, you'll need to have Anki installed on your computer. Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy because it is a lot more efficient than traditional study methods.

### Installing Anki
1. Download Anki for your operating system from [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Follow the installation instructions on the website to install the application on your device.

### Using the Decks
1. Clone this repository or download the desired decks from the **/decks/** directory.
2. Open Anki, and select `File > Import` from the top menu.
3. Browse to the location of the downloaded deck file and select it to import.

## Usage Examples
Once you have imported the decks into Anki, you can start using them as follows:
- Select a deck from the main Anki window.
- Click on "Study Now" to start a study session.
- Anki will show you cards from the deck, and you can rate how well you remembered the information.
- Anki schedules the next review of each card depending on how well you remembered it.

## How to Contribute
We encourage contributions from students and educators! If you have a good understanding of algorithms and wish to contribute to the Anki decks, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Make a branch in your fork for your contributions.
3. **Add or Modify Cards**: Add new cards or improve existing ones in your branch. Ensure that your cards are clear, concise, and accurate.
4. **Follow Formatting Guidelines**: Check the **/guidelines/** directory for specific formatting rules for the cards.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're done, submit a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Please provide a clear description of your changes.
